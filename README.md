## 📌 Project Title
**Blockchain-Based Certificate Issuer**

---

## 📘 Project Description
This project implements a decentralized certificate issuing system using blockchain technology. 
Through a smart contract, institutions can securely issue, store, and verify student certificates. 
The immutability of blockchain ensures that certificates cannot be tampered with or forged.

## 🎯 Project Vision
To create a transparent and tamper-proof digital certificate system that ensures trust, 
authenticity, and easy verification for students, companies, and institutions, without relying 
on manual or centralized verification processes.

## ⭐ Key Features
- **Secure & Tamper-Proof:** All certificates are stored on the blockchain, making them immutable.
- **Decentralized Verification:** Anyone can verify the authenticity of a certificate using certificate ID.
- **Smart Contract Controlled Issuance:** Only authorized institutions can issue certificates.
- **Public Transparency:** Certificate details are stored publicly and can be fetched anytime.
- **Revocation Support:** Certificates can be revoked by the issuer if needed.
